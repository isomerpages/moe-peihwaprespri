#### For vehicles coming into and exiting schools

Parents can drive into the school to drop off their children at the school porch from 6.30 am to 7.15 am. No waiting is allowed on the school porch.



#### Safe route for vehicles

Vehicles enter from Main Gate, slow down for security check, turn right and keep left. Drive through the driveway towards the porch. Keep within the speed limit of 15km/hr. Drop-off at the porch. After the passenger alights at the porch, drive along the driveway and exit at Gate 2 to leave the school.

#### For vehicles outside the school compound

Parents should refrain from parking or stopping their vehicles along Pei Wah Ave. If they need to wait for their children, they are advised to park their vehicles at the URA car park next to the food center or HDB car park near the back gate.

#### Safe route for Pedestrians

Pedestrians are to enter and leave the school through the gate at the security guard room and cross at the zebra crossing.

 
These measures are taken to provide a safe environment for all Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School students and staff.

## Traffic Safety Announcement

#### Illegal Parking and Waiting along Pei Wah Ave During School Dismissal  

Dear Parent/Guardian,  

We have observed that some parents/guardians are parking and waiting along Pei Wah Ave and outside the school gate during school dismissal timings at 1.30 pm and 4 pm. This has caused traffic obstruction to the school buses and chartered buses returning from school Learning Journey, posed a traffic safety risk to our children walking out of school, and delayed school dismissal. We seek your kind understanding to park your cars at the nearby public carparks and not to park along Pei Wah Ave to wait for your child. LTA traffic attendants will also issue summons to vehicles that are parked illegally along a single white line.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation to keep everyone safe. 


  

  

#### Vehicles parking or waiting at Toh Yi Estate During School Dismissal

Dear Parent/Guardian,  

  

We have received feedback from the residents of Toh Yi Estate that our school parents are parking or waiting for their child during school dismissal timings in the season parking lots at Toh Yi Estate outside the school back gate.  This has caused inconvenience to the residents who cannot park at their season parking lots when they return home from work. 

  

We would like to appeal to parents not to park or wait in the season parking lots which are meant for Toh Yi residents and not to stop your car to wait along the road.  Kindly park or wait in non-season parking lots with the due parking coupon.  Please also minimize using your horn as the residents have feedback that there has been an increase in cars horning especially during dismissal time.



We seek your understanding and cooperation.  

Thank you.<br>
Management of  <br>
Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School
