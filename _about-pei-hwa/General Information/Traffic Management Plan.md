#### For vehicles coming into and exiting schools

Parents can drive into the school to drop off their children at the school porch from 6.30 am to 7.15 am. No waiting is allowed on the school porch.



#### Safe route for vehicles

Vehicles enter from Main Gate, slow down for security check, turn right and keep left. Drive through the driveway towards the porch. Keep within the speed limit of 15km/hr. Drop-off at the porch. After the passenger alights at the porch, drive along the driveway and exit at Gate 2 to leave the school.

#### For vehicles outside the school compound

Parents should refrain from parking or stopping their vehicles along Pei Wah Ave. If they need to wait for their children, they are advised to park their vehicles at the URA car park next to the food center or HDB car park near the back gate.

#### Safe route for Pedestrians

Pedestrians are to enter and leave the school through the gate at the security guard room and cross at the zebra crossing.

 
These measures are taken to provide a safe environment for all Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School students and staff.
