**Zest for Learning**

In line with its desire to nurture a zest for learning, the school has deliberately attempt to go beyond grades, beyond the transactional approach of sitting and clearing examinations, to imbuing the love for learning. We develop **effective communication** skills of all students through the school’s **Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**. The 6-year progressive programme teaches students thinking skills (such as divergent, convergent, organization and analysis skills) so that they are able to express themselves clearly in oral and written forms. The programme develops students to be **Competent and Confident Communicators** with coherence and clarity in thought and expression through activities such as story-telling, public speaking and drama appreciation. The school values and the 21CC are incorporated into every stage of the programme.

We nurture students to be passionate sportspersons and upright contributing leaders with strength of character.  **STAR@PHPPS** which stands for “Self-defence, Track and Field, Adventuring and Racquet Games” is the school’s **Learning for Life Programme (LLP)**. The A3 Instructional Approach ensures that students acquire broad-based sports knowledge, values and skills. They then apply their learning through authentic platforms such as group work, camps, CCA, VIA, Outdoor Education and learning journeys. Students experience affirmation of their application of knowledge, values and skills through reflection, celebration of learning and positive comments from teachers and parents.
