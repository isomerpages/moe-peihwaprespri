The Citizenship Education at Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School (PHPPS) is part of our holistic education and entails a whole school approach, involving pupils, parents, teachers and our community. We promote citizenship education through the infusion of Citizenship Dispositions in our National Education (NE) Commemorative Events, Social Studies Curriculum and NE Learning Journeys. This will enable our children to instill **a love for home** and to realize their part to be **informed, concerned and participative citizens who will serve their community and nation**.
