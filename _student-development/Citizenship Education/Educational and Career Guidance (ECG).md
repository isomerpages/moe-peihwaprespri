Educational and Career Guidance (ECG) aims at equipping pupils with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed education and career decisions. Through ECG, pupils are provided with opportunities to learn more about their own interests, abilities and passions. By exploring various education and career pathways across different industries, pupils can take positive steps towards realizing their aspirations.

  

The **MySkillsFuture portal** for pupils is a one-stop ECG portal that empowers our Primary 5 and Primary 6 pupils to embark on a journey of self-discovery to the wide array of occupations, including new jobs created in the ever-changing world of work. Pupils can use the information and tools available to explore their educational and career interests.
