**NDP 2020 - Singapore Together Pack, Art Work Design by Goh Kate Lynn**  

Our pupil, Goh Kate Lynn from 5 Loyalty 4, took part in the NDP 2020 Funpack Artwork Contest on the theme "Emerge Stronger Together" to express her hopes and aspirations for Singapore. We are happy to share that her art work was selected as one of the NDP Fun Pack Designs.   

See Kate Lynn's artwork and read her story behind her creation. Let her artwork, along with its message, remind and inspire all Singaporeans to overcome our challenges as one so that we can look forward with renewed confidence and conviction.

### Stories Behind The Artwork  "Staying United" ----- Goh Kate Lynn, Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School

Through her artwork, Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School’s Goh Kate Lynn wished to emphasise the importance of unity in a unique way through the metaphor of a balloon.  

The artwork portrays Kate (the girl standing in front) with her parents and younger brother, each holding onto strings of a large heart-shaped balloon bearing the Singapore flag. She explained: “All of us need to hold the balloon down together. If we don't, the balloon will fly away. It is just like Singapore – if we don't stay united, Singapore will become chaotic and things will get uncontrollable.”

With their other hands, they are all holding onto the island of Singapore. Just as how all of them must hold the balloon, if only one of them were to support the island, it would topple. The artwork suggests that none of us are any less essential than others, that we all have our own roles to play in growing Singapore.

Kate produced this artwork with her younger brother. They dipped paintbrushes and toothbrushes into paint and then tapped the brushes, creating the pattern of the flag. An extremely close pair, they also frequently cycle and ride their scooters together. Beyond these, Kate enjoys baking and playing with her neighbours at the playground.

Earlier this year, in art class, she drew a picture of appreciation to doctors and nurses which was selected to be printed on flyers given to healthcare workers. With her cheerful drawing style, art is not only Kate’s hobby but also serves as her means of bringing joy to others.
