#### Discipline

Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School (PHPPS) adopts values-based discipline.  Discipline is not about only enforcing behavioural compliance in pupils according to school rules and regulations. Rather, it is an educative process that focuses on enduring gains in pupils. It is the development of our pupils’ moral faculties, by instruction and exercise, in accordance to established rules. Fundamentally, a school discipline programme aims to guide pupils to the truth of and internalize the school values and code of behaviour, and support pupils to:  
  

*   Take responsibility for their learning and development and participate actively in learning activities;
*   Take responsibility for their actions and make restitution to address any harm that their actions may have caused;
*   Become an active member of the school community and take actions that contribute to the building of a safe, secure, caring and conducive learning environment.

PHPPS adopts CSI questions to engage pupils in a responsible thinking process.  We use CSI questions to help pupils who had violated the school rules on self-management.  We get pupils to reflect on how their actions are inappropriate and understand how their actions had affected others.  We use CSI questions to re-direct pupils to amend their actions, work towards an improvement in their self-awareness and management and suggest ways to restore relationships.

#### Student Management Programmes

Discipline takes time, effort and guidance for pupils to internalise the acceptable behaviour that aligns to the school values, beliefs and code of conduct.  We aim to develop our pupils into individuals with self-discipline, to take responsibility for their actions and demonstrate care for others by imbuing them the school values and equipping them with the necessary social emotional competencies.  We believe that discipline works best with quality teacher-pupil relationships.  We develop our pupils’ social-emotional competencies through our specially-designed pupil management programmes and individualised support that include:

  

*   Form-Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)
*   Class Bonding Interactive Activities
*   Anti-Bullying Programme
*   Peer Support Programme
*   Emotional Self-Regulation Programme (Group Guidance Programme)
*   Class or Level Talk by HOD, Year Head or School Leader
*   Weekly goal and timely reinforcement for positive behaviour during assemblies
*   Termly School Values Class Awards
*   P6 Transition to Secondary School Talks
*   Counselling Sessions
*   Learning Behavioural Support Sessions
