### Character Education

At Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School (PHPPS), we believe that Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is key and critical in the holistic development of our pupils. As a Christian mission school, we are guided by the 6 school values of Integrity, Respect, Responsibility, Teamwork, Loyalty and Resilience and the school motto: Loyalty and Honesty. With these values as a foundation, pupils are guided to realise the school’s vision and mission, to have a heart for others and a love for home so that they will be good individuals and useful citizens who will serve God and the nation.

 The Values Education in PHPPS focuses on equipping the pupils with values, competencies, and skills that will guide them to make appropriate choices, determine their behaviours and attitudes towards self, others and the community. These positive attributes will develop them into morally upright, caring and responsible citizens. The 6 school values and their corresponding value practices are covered in detail within a year as shown below:

### Values in Action (VIA) Students  

VIA is an important component of Character and Citizenship Education. It is a learning experience that supports pupils’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. It fosters pupils’ ownership of their learning and contributions to the community. However, with the Covid-19 situation, we have modified our VIA Programme for some levels to be carried out at home and in school. This enhanced VIA Programme retains its original intent of providing the platforms for the pupils to play their part through meaningful contributions to their home, school and community.

### Values in Action (VIA) STAFF

In February, Singapore suddenly found herself in the middle of a health crisis as we saw our first Covid-19 infection in our lands. From then on, our healthcare personnel have found themselves placed in the frontline to help keep our people safe and fight to save those who have been infected with this novel virus. 

At Pei Hwa Presbyterian, we see the importance of that job and understand the pressure that the healthcare workers must have felt throughout these months.  Thus, as part of our staff community outreach efforts, we have put together a total of 500 COVID (Carry On! Valiant In Defence) care packs for NUH healthcare workers who work tirelessly around the clock. Through the small packs and the notes of encouragement from our staff, we hope that it will lift the spirits of these frontline workers to continue the fight with us!
