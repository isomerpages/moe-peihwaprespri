Leadership is not just about an assigned position; it is not about a single person who runs an entire organisation neither is it something for a chosen few. We believe that a leader first learns to lead self before he or she leads others.  A leader is one who exerts positive influence within his or her sphere of influence, and thereby be a leader in his or her own right. The school adopts the 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership (5 PEL) by James M. Kouzes and Barry Z Posner in the development of leadership qualities in all our students. The explicit teaching of the 5 PEL and related skills are taught over the 6 years through assembly talks or class-based leadership lessons. Pupils are given opportunities to apply their knowledge and skills learnt at class group work, Values-In-Action Projects, level camp and CCA sessions.  

  

#### 5 Practices of Examplary Leadership

Each pupil will learn about the 5 PEL systematically, as planned in the 6-year leadership development plan.
