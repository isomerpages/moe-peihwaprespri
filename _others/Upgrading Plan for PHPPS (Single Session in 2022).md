Dear Parents / Guardians,  
  
**UPDATES ON UPGRADING PLAN FOR PEI HWA PRESBYTERIAN PRIMARY SCHOOL**   
  
1. We had earlier informed you in March 2020 about the renovation works that will be carried out within the school’s compound and carpark area as part of the school’s upgrading. We would like to update you on the changes to the upgrading plans.   
  
2. Due to the current COVID-19 situation, works for the school’s upgrading have been halted. This affected our plans to operate as a single session from January 2021, as the sheltered courts to provide spaces for PE lessons and the internal road to reduce traffic congestion could not be completed in time  
  
3. Hence, we would like to inform you that the school will **continue to function in a partial-single session (i.e. Primary 1-2 students in the afternoon session and Primary 3-6 students in the morning session) for another year until December 2021.**   
  
4. We seek your continued support as we work together to provide a quality learning experience for your child. Should you require any further information, please contact Mr Vincent Tan, Vice-Principal (Administration), at 6466 3787.
