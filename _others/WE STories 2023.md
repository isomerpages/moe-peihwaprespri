Dear Parents/Guardians, &nbsp;  
  

WE STories is a collection of stories from our west zone secondary schools to profile the strengths and distinctiveness of west zone secondary schools. We hope that WE STories will enable our P6 students and parents to make an informed choice as they consider the secondary schools that best suit their needs, interests, and aspirations.
