### Instructions for Primary School Students and Parents  

**NOTE TO PARENTS**

We would like to encourage all parents to help your child in the management of his/her SLS account. This would involve helping your child to remember his/her username and password, as well as entering your email address in SLS, so that a password reset via self-help can be performed in the event that the password is forgotten.

**MANAGING YOUR SLS ACCOUNT**  

Log in to SLS (**[https://learning.moe.edu.sg](https://learning.moe.edu.sg/)**) using your existing username and password. If you have forgotten your password, you may request for your teacher to reset your password. Then log in to SLS using the one-time password which your teacher has provided you.

  

After logging in with the one-time password provided by your teacher, or if your existing password has expired, you will be prompted to change your password. You will need to key in your new password twice. Please note that the password must contain alphanumeric characters and is case-sensitive. It should:   

a. be 8 characters or longer;

b. contain at least 1 letter and 1 digit; and

c. be changed every year (you will be directed to the change password page automatically)
