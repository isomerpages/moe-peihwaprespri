**Q1 : I have forgotten my password. What should I do?**

Please refer to **paragraphs 6-9** in [**Annex A.**](https://staging.d3ud1e33ljueqf.amplifyapp.com/others/student-learning-space-sls/getting-started-annex-a)

**Q2 : I have forgotten my username. What should I do?**

The format of your user name is a combination of the first 5 characters of your Name, the last 4 digits and the letter of your NRIC/FIN/BC, e.g. (RACHE1234Z).

In rare cases, two or more students might share the same 10 characters. In such cases, their username may be affixed with a number, e.g. (RACHE1234Z\_01).

If you are still not sure of your username, please approach your teacher.

**Q3 : My account has been locked. What should I do?**

Your account will be locked after **6 consecutive** attempts to log in with an incorrect password.

Please call the SLS Helpdesk to unlock your account. You will need to answer the security questions to verify that you are the legitimate account holder.
