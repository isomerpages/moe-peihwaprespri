			<br>Our company meets on Friday afternoons, from 2pm to 4pm, where junior girls get to interact with fellow mates through badge work activities, drill practices, games, community services and commemoration of special events. <br> 
			<br>The junior girls get opportunities to attend national events . Fast-Food &amp; Fuzz Camp is catered to the Year 2 (P4) junior girls. <br>It is an experiential camp where junior girls learnt about fasting from elaborate food and experienced through simulations of the harsh conditions that children from developing countries face daily. <br>
			<br>The girls were taught to appreciate the things they have, to give thanks in all circumstances and pray for people in need. Junior Leadership Training Camp (JLTC) is for selected Year 3 (P5) junior girls. <br>
			<br>During the camp, the girls were equipped with relevant knowledge and skills to lead confidently. They went through experiential learning to build their character and resilience. 
			<br>
			<br>We commemorate Girls’ Brigade Day in July annually. The junior girls also take part in raising funds through the GB Fortnight. <br>They get to serve in community through GB Friendship Day. Girls’ Brigade aims to develop each girl and officer to her fullest potential by equipping, empowering and enabling: every girl a leader, every officer a servant leader.
