<br><strong>Key Programmes Activities</strong>
<br>
<br>Our company meets on Friday afternoons, from 2pm to 4pm, where junior
girls get to interact with fellow mates through badge work activities,
drill practices, games, community services and commemoration of special
events.
<br>
<br>The junior girls get opportunities to attend national events . Fast-Food
&amp; Fuzz Camp is catered to the Year 2 (P4) junior girls.
<br>It is an experiential camp where junior girls learnt about fasting from
elaborate food and experienced through simulations of the harsh conditions
that children from developing countries face daily.
<br>
<br>The girls were taught to appreciate the things they have, to give thanks
in all circumstances and pray for people in need. Junior Leadership Training
Camp (JLTC) is for selected Year 3 (P5) junior girls.
<br>
<br>During the camp, the girls were equipped with relevant knowledge and skills
to lead confidently. They went through experiential learning to build their
character and resilience.
<br>
<br>We commemorate Girls’ Brigade Day in July annually. The junior girls also
take part in raising funds through the GB Fortnight.
<br>They get to serve in community through GB Friendship Day. Girls’ Brigade
aims to develop each girl and officer to her fullest potential by equipping,
empowering and enabling: every girl a leader, every officer a servant leader.
