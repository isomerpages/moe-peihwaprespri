## Learning for Life Programme (LLP)
##### 	Objective: 
	Developing passionate sportspersons and upright contributing leaders with strength of character.

The schoolâ€™s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) aims to tap on the many affordances of using sports as a platform for character-building and to inculcate leadership qualities in our students. Students develop their interest in sports through exposure to a variety of sports experiences with the hope of motivating them to see sports as a life-long pursuit.  In the process of active sports participation, students are also provided with opportunities to acquire and demonstrate life skills and values.

Some of the key activities include

| Activities  | Aim  |
| -------- | -------- |
| **Sports Experiential Activities**      | Provide students with competition experience in an intra-school setting to facilitate the application of knowledge, skills and attitude. Students also learn to be good spectators of sports.         |
| **Learn to Play Sports Modules**     | Provide students opportunities to experience non-mainstream sports and widen their perception of what constitutes sports and the wide variety of physical activities they can pursue recreationally.         |
| **Modular Sports CCAs (P1 and 2)**| Allows students to experience a broad-based exposure to the sports CCAs offered by the school from young and inculcate a love for physical activities. By Primary 2, students will get to try out all the sports CCAs offered by the school on a termly rotation basis. Students explore their interest and make a more informed decision on their CCA choices subsequently. This also helps to widen the talent pool for CCAs and facilitate the pursuit of excellence for students.          |
|  **Sports CCAs**| Provides the platform for talented students to pursue their interest at a higher level and instill a mindset of excellence.       |
