TTLT is PHPSS’s cornerstone programme using the X3 development plan, focusing on the levels of extension and excellence.

  

It is a 2 year programme designed to develop a selected group of students who excels in specific disciplines and skills. The programme focuses on enhancing the child’s thinking process, leadership competency and communication skills through a skill-based developmental curriculum.

  

TTLT provides an opportunity for the identified group of students to go through a structured approach to develop their strengths and showcase their talents through different platforms such as school-wide presentations and national-level competitions.

  

The programme encompasses the 4 core subjects of English, Math, Chinese and Science. The overarching focus of the programme is to emphasize on skills, which would be evident in all 4 modules.
