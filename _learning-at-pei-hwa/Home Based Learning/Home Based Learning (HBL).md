Dear Parents,

As part of our efforts in monitoring our studentsâ€™ well-being, all students will be required to access SLS to do a daily check-in, they may do so anytime between 7:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. During the check-in, students will be asked to record their temperature.

Should you require assistance during FHBL period, the following are the helplines.
