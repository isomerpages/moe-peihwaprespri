### Music

Curricular Goal: Passionate Learners of Music

Our pupils will be passionate about, appreciate Music and will be able to express themselves through it.  They will be able to see the value and recognise the relevance of music in their lives and society.  They will acquire skills for creative expressions and explore ways to communicate their ideas, thoughts and feelings.

We provide pupils with a strong foundation in the development of basic music competencies and moral values using the A3 Instructional Approach and X3 Developmental Plan.  Our music programme provides structured music experiences for students to **acquire** the necessary knowledge, skills and values ( **Acquisition** ), apply and transfer their learning through authentic platforms ( **Application** ) and provides opportunities for them to reflect and engage in discussion so as to **affirm** their good performances and effective application. ( **Affirmation** ).


The school leverages on the **X 3 approach** of **eXposure** , **eXtension** and **eXcellence** to provide enriching learning opportunities for all progressively and nurture those who demonstrate strengths in music and performing arts to reach their peaks of excellence.
