**Department Vision**  

To develop physically active students who embrace a healthy lifestyle and enjoy sports and the outdoors.

**Department Goals:**

* Equip students with the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values towards the pursuit of a lifelong physically active and healthy lifestyle.  

* Use of the “5 Minds for the Future” framework to guide us in designing inclusive physical-related programmes to engage students of different abilities and develop their competencies in the physical, affective and cognitive domains.

* Develop students who think critically during physical activities through thoughtful questioning and the use of thinking routines.&nbsp;

* Care for students’ well-being while providing opportunities to develop their character and leadership.

**Programmes &amp; Activities:**
