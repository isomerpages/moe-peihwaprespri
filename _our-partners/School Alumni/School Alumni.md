<h4><strong>Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School (PHPPS) Alumni Association</strong></h4>
<p>Our Alumni Association was formed in July 2016 and our first Annual General
Meeting (AGM) was conducted on 18 May 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strong alumni is an asset to school as former students help to nurture
the school spirit, foster a sense of pride for the school and preserve
school traditions.&nbsp; The purpose of PHPPS Alumni Association is to
allow alumni members to strengthen their bond with the School, promote
loyalty and love for the School, fostering a sense of belonging and comradeship
amongst former students and staff.&nbsp; These intangible but fundamental
aspects of our school contribute to the formation and development of Pei
Hwa’s identity.&nbsp; All old boys and girls are encouraged to come on-board
and join us in making our network a vibrant community to support in achieving
the school’s vision.</p>
<p>We would like to encourage all our fellow alumni to participate our alumni
activities and support the School to achieve its education objectives and
outcomes.&nbsp; Stay connected through our PHPPS Alumni Facebook which
you could learn about the upcoming events and keep in touch with your classmates.</p>

<p>The Alumni Association continues to be an important avenue for supporting
our school and students, as well as a platform for former students to reconnect

ethos and traditions of our alma mater. We hope and encourage those who
join the alumni association to continue to contribute to the school.</p>
