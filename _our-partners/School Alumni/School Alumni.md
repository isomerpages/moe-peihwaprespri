#### Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School (PHPPS) Alumni Association

Our Alumni Association was formed in July 2016 and our first Annual General Meeting (AGM) was conducted on 18 May 2017.&nbsp;  
  
Strong alumni is an asset to school as former students help to nurture the school spirit, foster a sense of pride for the school and preserve school traditions.&nbsp; The purpose of PHPPS Alumni Association is to allow alumni members to strengthen their bond with the School, promote loyalty and love for the School, fostering a sense of belonging and comradeship amongst former students and staff.&nbsp; These intangible but fundamental aspects of our school contribute to the formation and development of Pei Hwa’s identity.&nbsp; All old boys and girls are encouraged to come on-board and join us in making our network a vibrant community to support in achieving the school’s vision.  
  
We would like to encourage all our fellow alumni to participate our alumni activities and support the School to achieve its education objectives and outcomes.&nbsp; Stay connected through our PHPPS Alumni Facebook which you could learn about the upcoming events and keep in touch with your classmates.

Alumni association continues to be an important avenue to support our school and students, as well as a platform for former students to reconnect and network.
