The Parent Gateway(PG) Mobile App is an initiative by MOE to enable parents to interact with schools more conveniently on administrative and financial matters. Parents will also be able to use this app to stay updated on school’s programme and activities.

  

The PG App will be implemented in all schools over the course of 2019. If you have two or more children and they are in different schools, you will be able to receive notifications for all your children on the same PG App.

  

The free app will bring several benefits, including:

*   Providing parents with timely information about school events (eg, enrichment and CCA activities)
*   Enabling parents to perform a range of functions including giving consent for school trips
*   Reducing usage of paper and decreasing environmental impact (hard-copies will no longer be provided)

  

We strongly encourage all parents to download and use the PG App as it will bring significant benefits for parents, teachers and the school.
